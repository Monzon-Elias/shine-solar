# shine-solar
Access the app here: https://monzon-elias.github.io/shine-solar I needed to use a gadget (Moesif CORS chrome extension) to avoid the CORS problem. 
I also added a "1" to the end of the URL, otherwise, I could not obtain a response from the server when doing the fetch request in POST mode.
